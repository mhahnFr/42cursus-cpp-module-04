## Welcome to 42cursus-cpp-module-04!
This is the fifth project featuring C++ at the [42 school].

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to learn the principles of inheritance using abstract classes and interfaces in C++.

In the first exercise, the very basic example of a ``Dog`` and a ``Cat`` class, that inherit from an ``Animal`` class,
is given. One can see the importance of the ``virtual`` keyword, as the example of the ``WrongAnimal`` and ``WrangCat``
shows. There, the method being overwritten is not marked ``virtual`` in the super class.

In the second exercise, the example of the first exercise is extended by an allocated ``Brain`` in the two subclasses.
It also teaches the principle of deeply copying an instance.

In the third exercise, the ``Animal`` class is made abstract.

The last exercise is completely different: a little game is implemented. It showcases the use of interfaces and abstract
classes, once the exercise is completed correctly, the game characters can use any other materias that might be added.
